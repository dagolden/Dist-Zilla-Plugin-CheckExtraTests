    - run tests on the built dist, so that things like XS will work

    - add RunExtraTests plugin, which runs the appropriate xt tests when "dzil
      test" is run (but only with the appropriate flags).

    - add 'xt' as command alias for 'xtest'

    - 'dzil xtest' now takes optional arguments that are
      treated as xt test filenames to run.  These will
      be found however deeply they are nested in xt.
