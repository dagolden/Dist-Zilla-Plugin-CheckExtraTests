    - change RunExtraTests plugin to avoid rebuilding the dist when
      it's not necessary (e.g. MakeMaker already ran the normal tests)
      (thanks, Christopher J. Madsen)

0.006     2012-05-10 23:08:11 America/New_York

    - run tests on the built dist, so that things like XS will work

    - add RunExtraTests plugin, which runs the appropriate xt tests when "dzil
      test" is run (but only with the appropriate flags).

0.005     2012-05-03 17:30:08 America/New_York

    - add 'xt' as command alias for 'xtest'

    - 'dzil xtest' now takes optional arguments that are
      treated as xt test filenames to run.  These will
      be found however deeply they are nested in xt.
