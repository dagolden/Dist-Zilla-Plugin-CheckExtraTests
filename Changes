Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-CheckExtraTests

{{$NEXT}}

    - change RunExtraTests plugin to avoid rebuilding the dist when
      it's not necessary (e.g. MakeMaker already ran the normal tests)
      (thanks, Christopher J. Madsen)

    - run tests on the built dist, so that things like XS will work

    - add RunExtraTests plugin, which runs the appropriate xt tests when "dzil
      test" is run (but only with the appropriate flags).

    - add 'xt' as command alias for 'xtest'

    - 'dzil xtest' now takes optional arguments that are
      treated as xt test filenames to run.  These will
      be found however deeply they are nested in xt.
